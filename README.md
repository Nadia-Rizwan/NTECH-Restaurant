# NTECH-Restaurant
This is a Restaurant application for the cashier basically.Cashier can place order for customers and take payments.
The all food items are listed in a dropdown menu with dynamically changing prices and discounts.
The total payment is also calculated.
However, the most important thing for me in this project is learning about modal,tuple and repository pattern.
The application is developed using c#,jquer,jason,bootstrap in asp.net mvc.
